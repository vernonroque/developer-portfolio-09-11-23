I am a Math Teacher looking for a career change. I have been learning the skills I need to become a front-end web developer. <br/><br/>

I am currently enrolled in the Codecademy Full-Stack Career Path which encompasses technologies used in both front-end and back-end development. 

Skills and technologies that I have learned through the curriculum are the following: html/css, javascript, react.js, redux.js, bash/terminal for mac, node.js, express.js, and postrgreSQL. <br/><br/>

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC). After 4 years working as a Systems Installation Engineer for Panasonic Avionics Corporation, I decided to take a break and travel through South America. 

I eventually settled in Colombia and decided to become a jazz musician. I play jazz saxophone. If you're curious, check out my youtube channel

During the pandemic, I rekindled my joy for engineering, specifically in the realm of computer science. I find software development to be engaging and challenging. 

And most importantly, I find that software development allows room for a lot of creativity and innovation. This is the reason I am pursuing a career in front-end development.<br/><br/>

I realize that my work experience may seem like an odyssey, but in the words of JRR Tolkien, <br/><br/> <span className="quote">â€œNot all those who wander are lost."</span><br/>

My eclectic experiences have shaped me into a more responsible, disciplined, and focused individual. 

Please take a look at my portfolio and let me know what you think. I made this portfolio using React.js.<br/><br/>
I look forward to hearing from you!<br/><br/>

Regards,<br/><br/>

Vernon Roque
